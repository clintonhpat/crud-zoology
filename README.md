## Reflection

  - This application was created in order to practice the utilization of basic CRUD operations and was my first approach to a full-stack project. The focus of this project was for me to learn a bit about back-end languages and how the entire process works together overall. The front-end for this app was created utilizing React and JSX and was initialized by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate.

  - The technologies implemented in this project are React, React Bootstrap, Express, MySql, React Router, React Hooks, JSX, and CSS. The `create-react-app` boilerplate was chosen to minimize initial setup time to invest more time into learning the structure of the codebases.
